# Cobalt Official Production Config Registration Files

These config registration files are used for production cobalt. Each of our
clients has a copy of a subset of these files. Therefore if you make any
changes to these files you must make corresponding changes in all of the
relevent client code.

Below we enumerate the customers and projects by ID:
